# 2D terminal game
# Wtf is it ?
This project is a 2D open world game (It's not really open world right now but at the end it will be) that runs in the terminal with pseudo-graphics (a pseudo-graphic example : (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ ).

# Why tf are you doing this ?
I'm doing this because my friend YouLeGamer and I are competing to prove which programming language is better between Python and Batch, so we decided to make a RPG game that runs in the terminal with pseudo-graphics. I code in Python and my friend in Batch.

# How tf that it works ???
So basically the code create a simple empty screen with walls then it addss obstacles ("#") to it thanks to a list with random positions that was created at the beginning of the code, then it place the player in the screen at his x and y positions.

For now you can only play in azerty (zqsd) but don't worry I'll add Controls Settings later.

# Support
The code is not working ?
Verify that :
- You run the code in the terminal.
- If you're using pycharm, click on the run menu at the top of the screen then click edit configurations and select "emulate in terminal" finally apply and close.
