# 2D terminal game
# Wtf is it ?
This project is a 2D open world game that runs in the terminal with pseudo-graphics (a pseudo-graphic example : (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ )

# Why tf are you doing this ?
I'm doing this because my friend YouLeGamer and I are competing to prove which programming language is better between Python and Batch, so we decided to make a RPG game that runs in the terminal with pseudo-graphics.

# How tf that it works ???

So basically

Controls : zqsd (qwerty coming soon)

/!\ IMPORTANT /!\
- You need to run the code in the terminal to make it work.
- If you're using pycharm, click on the run menu at the top of the screen/edit configurations/select "emulate in terminal"
